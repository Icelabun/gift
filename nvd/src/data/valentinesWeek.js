it would be the way I feel when I see your name pop up on my screen.
Soft. Warm. Impossible to ignore.
Just like you.”`,
  '02-08': `“I don’t need a big moment to say this.
I choose you.
In small moments.
In quiet days.
In ways that feel steady… and real.”`,
  '02-09': `“You’re sweet in the kind of way that sneaks up on me.
Not loud.
Not obvious.
Just enough to make me want more… every time.”`,
  '02-10': `“There’s something about you that feels safe.
Like I can relax around you.
Like I can be soft — and still feel strong.
That’s rare. And I don’t take it lightly.”`,
  '02-11': `“I promise effort.
I promise honesty.
I promise choosing you even on days that aren’t easy.
Not perfectly — but genuinely.”`,
  '02-12': `“If you were here right now,
I wouldn’t say much.
I’d just pull you close…
and let the moment do the talking.”`,
  '02-13': `“There’s a kind of closeness that doesn’t need permission.
The kind that lingers.
The kind that makes time slow down a little.
You know exactly what I mean.”`,
